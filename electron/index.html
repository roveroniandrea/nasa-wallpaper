    <p>Despite interfering moonlight, many denizens of planet Earth were able to watch this year&#39;s Perseid meteor shower. This pastoral scene includes local skygazers admiring the shower&#39;s brief, heavenly flashes in predawn hours near peak activity on August 13 from Nalati Grassland in Xinjiang, China. A composite, the image registers seven frames taken during a two hour span recording Perseid meteor streaks against a starry sky. Centered along the horizon is the Plough, the north&#39;s most famous asterism, though some might see the familiar celestial kitchen utensil known as the Big Dipper. Perhaps the year&#39;s most easily enjoyed meteor shower, Perseid meteors are produced as Earth itself sweeps through dust from periodic comet Swift-Tuttle. The dust particles are vaporized at altitudes of 100 kilometers or so as they plow through the atmosphere at 60 kilometers per second.</p>
